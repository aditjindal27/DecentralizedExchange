# SeatX

# NFT based Decentralized Exchange 

_Adit Jindal, Emma Dang, Avi Arora_

I created an online marketplace to sell college class seats based on Ethereum using Solidity smart contracts. A user can register their classes, and a contract will mint a classNFT that can be traded on the decentralized market. The market is based on Automatic Market Makers (AMM). The project was intended for personal use and assumes there exists a way to verify class seat ownership.
